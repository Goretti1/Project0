# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For my Project0 submission, I designed a website titled Galaxy Data. My website creates an avenue for people to buy subscription data for their data needs. This project is a frontend design of this website.

My website contains seven html pages, with Pricing and FAQs being external websites.

The Login button directs a user to the Login page where the user can fill in email and password to access their database.

The Login page contains a "Forgot your password link" that directs a user to a page where they can fill in their registration email in order to recover their password assuming they forget it.

The Register button directs a user to the Register page where a new user can create an account by filling in the required details.

There are four tabs in the website namely Home, Pricing, FAQs and Contact Us.

The Pricing and FAQs tabs direct users to external websites where they can check the prices of data, and access the answers to frequently asked questions respectively. The Home tab keeps the user in the index page. The Contact Us tab directs the user to a page where details of customer service agents and Whatsapp contacts are provided.

A majority of the codes in Login, Register and Forgot password pages were extracted from the Paycheap website.
